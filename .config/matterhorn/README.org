Matterhorn is a mattermost TUI client.

* Connection

Being I'm using SAML to login on the mattermost community server and API tokens are disabled, I use a "hack" consisting in using my ~MMAUTHTOKEN~ cookie as an token. The token is stored in my password store.

* Keybindings

Some useful keybindings:
