#+TITLE: Xmonad
* Xmonad

Xmonad is a dynamic tiling window manager. What's particualr about it and it's configuration is that Xmonad provide a library, and your configuration is actually the "main" code that'll call the library, offering you a lot of flexibility

** Installation steps

When in doubt... [[https://xmonad.org/INSTALL.html][check the official documentation]]!

We compile xmobar to allow us to add code into the configuration.

1. make sure =stack= is installed (better installing it using their script @ [[https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/][Stack: Install guide]]
2. clone [[https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad][xmonad]], [[https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad-contrib][xmonad-contrib]] and [[https://github.com/cdepillabout/pretty-simple][pretty-simple]] in this repository
3. run ~stack init~ and ~stack install~
4. We had to make an executable file named =build= in the directory to tell xmonad how to recompile itself

** My Keybindings

Those shortcuts uses Emacs notation, with M=Super/Windows key.

So..

- C-S-k = Control + Shift + k
