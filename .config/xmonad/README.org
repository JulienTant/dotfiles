#+TITLE: Xmonad
* Xmonad

Xmonad is a dynamic tiling window manager. What's particualr about it and it's configuration is that Xmonad provide a library, and your configuration is actually the "main" code that'll call the library, offering you a lot of flexibility

** Installation steps

When in doubt... [[https://xmonad.org/INSTALL.html][check the official documentation]]!

We compile xmobar to allow us to add code into the configuration.

1. make sure =stack= is installed (better installing it using their script @ [[https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/][Stack: Install guide]]
2. clone [[https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad][xmonad]], [[https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad-contrib][xmonad-contrib]], [[https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad-extras][xmonad-extras]] and [[https://github.com/cdepillabout/pretty-simple][pretty-simple]] in this repository

#+BEGIN_SRC
git clone git@github.com:xmonad/xmonad.git
git clone https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad-contrib.git
git clone https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad-extras.git
git clone https://github.com/cdepillabout/pretty-simple.git
#+END_SRC

3. run ~stack init~ (probably unnecessary) and ~stack install~
4. We had to make an executable file named =build= in the directory to tell xmonad how to recompile itself
5. copy the desktop file to =/usr/share/xsessions/xmonad.desktop=

** My Workspaces

I like when a workspace is stricly attached to a screen, it makes my workflow more predictable. Right now this is what I have:

- www: left screen
- code: right screen
- sys (my terminals): left screen
- chat: right screen
- 5,6,7,8: unused
- email: right
- music: right -- note: I think I'll end up moving music to a scratchpad.

** My Keybindings

Those shortcuts uses Emacs notation, with M=Super/Windows key.

So..
- M-p = Super/Windows+p
- C-S-k = Control + Shift + k
